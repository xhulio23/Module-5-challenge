# Module-5-challenge

In this challenge, I had the pleasure of applying the new skills learned in class such as creating the different visuals like bar graph, pie chart, scatter plot and line graphs. 

All codes used were from instructor led classes and also from youtube tutorials as well. 

Thank you for reading!
